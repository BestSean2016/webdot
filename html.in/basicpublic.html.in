<font color="darkred">Notice: Although webdot can be configured as a public server, we don't particularly recommend it.
Webdot contains insufficient mechanisms for limiting the load on a public server.
Instead we recommend that you set up a webdot server just for your own graphs in LOCALHOSTONLY mode: i.e. where the source graph is always on the same host as the webdot server.
</font>
<p>
If a public WebDot server is available then graphs can be served without
installing WebDot locally.  For example, if there is a graph at:
<a href="http://www.graphviz.org/demo.dot">http://www.graphviz.org/demo.dot</a>
<p>
then this img tag in an html web page:
<table border="1"><tr><td><pre>
&lt;img src="http://64.143.228.80/cgi-bin/webdot<b>/http://www.graphviz.org/demo.dot</b>.dot<b>.png</b>"
    alt="graph from public webdot server"&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
will produce the graph layout at the top of this page.
