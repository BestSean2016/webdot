WebDot is a CGI program that converts a graph description from
a .dot file into an image that can be included on a web page.
(As distributed, "Server 1" and "Server 2" are constrained to
be the same host. If anyone wants to run a public WebDot server
they can easily relax this constraint.)

WebDot is written in Tcl using the Tcldot package from
<a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">graphviz-tcl</a>.
<h2>Where can I get it?</h2>
The latest version of WebDot is available from:
<a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">http://www.graphviz.org/</a>
<h2>What does it need to run?</h2>
WebDot requires: <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">graphviz-tcl</a>
and a web server such as <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a>.
WebDot has been developed and tested primarily on Fedora systems.
<h2>Demos?</h2>
The <a href="demo.html">demo page</a> lists all of the demo graphs currently
distributed with the <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">graphviz</a> package,
with links to neato or dot layouts, in png, ps, pdf or svgz output formats.
Other formats are available from the png result page.
<h2>How do I use it?</h2>
There is an online tutorial describing how to use WebDot:

<h2>Who wrote it?</h2>
WebDot was written by <a mailto:ellson@research.att.com>John Ellson</a>
and is released under a BSD-style license.
<h2>Warnings</h2>
It's difficult to find a TCL plugin that works any more,
so the Tclets tutorial page probably won't load for you.
