<p>
In order to support client-side maps, WebDot can filter an
html page and replace all occurrences of &lt;webdot...&gt; tags
with a client-side map and an image reference.  

For example, $SELF.dot contains:
$DOT
and the source of this page contains (for the graph on the right):
<table border=1><tr><td><pre>
&lt;webdot src="$BASE/$SELF.dot" engine="neato" type="png" target="new"&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
after serving this page through $CGIBASE, this &lt;webdot...&gt;
tag is replaced by:
<table border=1><tr><td><pre>
&lt;map name="webdot0"&gt;
&lt;area href="$CGIBASE/http://127.0.0.1$BASE/$SELF.dot.neato.png.help"
	shape="rect"
	coords="160,223,248,235"
	target="new"&gt;
&lt;area href="$BASE/a.html"
	shape="rect"
	coords="1,126,73,174"
	target="new"&gt;
&lt;area href="$BASE/b.html"
	shape="rect" coords="101,101,173,149"
	target="new"&gt;
&lt;area href="$BASE/c.html"
	shape="rect"
	coords="173,173,245,221"
	target="new"&gt;
&lt;area href="$BASE/d.html"
	shape="rect"
	coords="128,2,200,50"
	target="new"&gt;
&lt;area href="$BASE/default.html"
	shape="default"
	target="new"&gt;
&lt;/map&gt;
&lt;img src="$CGIBASE/http://127.0.0.1$BASE/$SELF.dot.neato.png"
	width="248" height="235" border="0"
	usemap="#webdot0"
	alt="Graph by WebDot"&gt;
</pre></td></tr></table>
<p>
The advantages of this mode of WebDot are the much simpler authoring and
the responsiveness of client-side mapping.  Notice that the URL that
would be reached by clicking on a node is flashed into the
status bar at the bottom of the browser.
<p>
The disadvantages are that the html source now contains non-standard markup and 
the page has to be served through the $CGIBASE program.
Care must be taken that relative URLs in the html don't also get served
through the WebDot cgi program so it is important to use "rooted" hrefs
in documents and graphs served this way.
<p>
Embedded SVG is probably a better choice assuming SVG clients are available.
