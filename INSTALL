	To use the graphviz GIF/PNG/JPEG generator with Unix, you need
	to install TrueType fonts.  For copyright reasons, we don't
	bundle any fonts with graphviz, or webdot.  You may have a
	licensed copy on a nearby PC in C:\Windows\Fonts,
	or you can obtain fonts from:
       	http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fontpack/default.htm
	or you can download some suitable fonts with:

	mkdir /usr/share/ttf
	cd /usr/share/ttf

	unzip -L webfonts.exe

	match RedHat 7.0 conventions)
