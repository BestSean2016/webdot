WebDot is a CGI program that converts a graph description from
a .dot file into an image that can be included on a web page.
(As distributed, "Server 1" and "Server 2" are constrained to
be the same host. If anyone wants to run a public WebDot server
they can easily relax this constraint.)

<p>
WebDot is written in Tcl using the Tcldot package from
<a href=http://www.graphviz.org/>Graphviz</a>.
<h2>Where can I get it?</h2>
The latest version of WebDot is available from:
<a href=http://www.graphviz.org/pub/graphviz/>http://www.graphviz.org/pub/graphviz/</a>
<h2>What does it need to run?</h2>
WebDot requires: <a href=http://www.graphviz.org/>graphviz</a>
and a web server (an httpd) such as <a href=http://www.apache.org/>apache</a>.
WebDot has been developed and tested primarily on RedHat 6.2 and 7.0 systems.
On RedHat 7.0 systems the glibc update is required.
<h2>Demos?</h2>
The <a href=demo.html>demo page</a> lists all of the demo graphs currently
distributed with the <a href=http://www.graphviz.org/>graphviz</a> package,
with links to neato or dot layouts, in png, tcl, or pdf output formats.
Other formats are available from the png format page.
<h2>How do I use it?</h2>
There is an online tutorial describing how to use WebDot:
<ol>
<li><a href=tut1.html>Basic graph creation</a>
<li><a href=tut2.html>Clickable nodes</a>
<li><a href=tut3.html>Clickable edges</a>
<li><a href=/cgi-bin/webdot/webdot/tut4.html>Client side maps</a>
<li><a href=/cgi-bin/webdot/webdot/tut5.html>Embedded SVG graphs</a>
<li><a href=/cgi-bin/webdot/webdot/tut6.html>Graphs in Tclets</a>
</ol>
<h2>Who wrote it?</h2>
WebDot was written by <a mailto:ellson@graphviz.org>John Ellson</a>
and is released under a BSD-style license.
<h2>Warnings</h2>
Embedded SVG graphics are only known to work in
<A HREF="http://www.w3c.org/Amaya">Amaya</A>, maybe or
maybe not in Netscape (though odds are good for recent releases
of <A HREF=http://www.mozilla.org>Mozilla</A>), and particularly
ours definitely does not in Microsoft Internet Explorer,
which doesn't implement the HTML-4 &lt;<tt>OBJECT</tt>&gt; tag.
You can probably get embedded SVG to work with MSIE and
the <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/main.html">Adobe
SVG plugin</A>
renderer and a lot of fiddling with HTML wrappers and the
XML header, but the day grows long...
<P>
This is the paragraph where we blame Microsoft for having
made it so nearly impossible to create cross-platform
embedded content, like Java or SVG, having accidentally
on-purpose (OH DID I STEP ON YOUR BUSINESS PLAN? I'M SUCH
A KLUTZ!) thwarted the best intentions of everyone else
to make software that would work for as many people as possible.
<P>
It's difficult to find a TCL plugin that works any more,
so the last tutorial page probably won't load for you.
