WebDot is a server-side graph layout engine
that allows authors to publish .dot files
and have them rendered in their .html pages 
as .png with associated imagemaps.

There are three things you need to do to install WebDot:

1. Install prerequisites:

	tcl8.3 ( http://www.scriptics.org/ )
	graphviz
	Apache httpd (or other web server)
	Ghostscript 
	TrueType fonts
	xv (required for testing only)

2. Check the paths in the first few lines of the Makefile
to reflect your installation of:

	tclsh
	gs
	ps2epsi
	TrueType fonts
	httpd server name
	httpd server cgi-bin directory

3. Then type 'make install' to complete the installation.

For testing, 'make test' emulates a CGI environment around
the installed CGI to produce a PNG which is then viewed
with xv. This allows testing independant of the httpd.
