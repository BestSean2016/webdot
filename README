WebDot is a server-side graph layout engine
that allows authors to publish .dot files
and have them rendered in their .html pages 
as .png with associated imagemaps.

There are three things you need to do to install WebDot:

1. Install prerequisites:

	tcl8.3 ( http://www.scriptics.org/ )
	gd-1.8.1p1 ( ftp://ftp.graphviz.org/pub )
	Gdtclft ( ftp://ftp.graphviz.org/pub )
	Tcldot ( from Graphviz )
	Apache httpd (or other web server)
	Ghostscript 
	TrueType fonts
	xv (required for testing only)

3. Check the paths in the first few lines of the Makefile
to reflect your installation of:

	tclsh
	gs
	ps2epsi
	TrueType fonts
	httpd server name
	httpd server docroot
	installation dir for webdot under docroot
	cgi script name for webdot

Then type 'make install' to complete the installation.

For testing, 'make test' emulates a CGI environment around
the installed CGI to produce a PNG which is then viewed
with xv. This allows testing independant of the httpd.

3.  The web server must be configured to allow execution
of .cgi filetypes as CGI programs.  For Apache servers, typically
/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf should contain the following additions:

	LoadModule cgi_module         modules/mod_cgi.so
	AddModule mod_cgi.c
	AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
	<Directory /home/httpd/html/webdot>
		DirectoryIndex index.cgi
		Options Indexes FollowSymLinks ExecCGI
		AllowOverride None
		order allow,deny
		allow from all
	</Directory>
